    <p className="profile-details">
      I'm a computer science and technology passionated since I was a child, and I feel lucky to work on it during 14 years.
      After working with different languages and technologies related to Backend and Frontend along my career, I have become a 
      reference in the last projects in which I have collaborated.
        </p>
    <p className="profile-details">
      I am currently Senior Software Engineer at Taxfix, always trying to learn and improve with my team mates,
      applying best practices, developing clean code and relying on the latest technologies.
        </p>
    <p className="profile-details">
      If you can't find me doing some commits on GitHub I am probably traveling, playing Super Mario, listening to some great electronic music,
      reading a Batman comic or automating my house with the latest Xiaomi toy.
        </p>
